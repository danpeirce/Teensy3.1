# Teensy 3.1

Notes Related to Teensy 3.1 ARM MCU Board

* [The Teensy 3.1 web page](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensy31.html)

The Teensy 3.1 board can be used for projects written in C, Arduino and/or MicroPython. I'm intrigued by the 
possibilities in an educational setting. With that in mind I will acquire one of these boards and explore the possibilities.

## Installation

The pjrc Teensy web page gives a good set of instructions on the installation for the Teensy 3.1. 
The steps include downloading software for Arduino and then downloading and installing Teensyduino. 
Even the Micro Python project assumes this will be done.

* [PJRC - Download Teensyduino, Version 1.19](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html)

I'll need to get a board to try this.

## Using Teensy 3.1 With the Arduino IDE

Followed the instructions on the PJRC Teensy website. I tried one of the simple Arduino examples that blinks a LED. I then made a change to the blink rate and duty cycle. All worked as expected.

A number of lines of comments were pulled out.

```arduino
/*
  Blink --   This example code is in the public domain.
*/

int led = 13;

// the setup routine runs once:
void setup() {                
  // initialize the digital pin as an output.
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);     
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(led, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(100);               // wait for a 0.1 second
  digitalWrite(led, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(900);               // wait for a 0.9 second
}
```

## Using Teensy 3.1 Without the Arduino IDE
 
### This was run under Windows.

See 
* <http://forum.pjrc.com/threads/24861-Teensy-3-1-without-arduino-IDE>
* <https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/gcc.html>

Followed the essential instructions on the teensy web pages by changing references in the makefile to refer to the 3.1 and not the 3.0. For this 
(all references to 128 were changed to 256).

One section seemed to indicate I should change the line commented out for windows but it turned out the comment was wrong and 
I left it like it is to work on windows computer.

```
# path location for Teensy Loader, teensy_post_compile and teensy_reboot
TOOLSPATH = $(ARDUINOPATH)/hardware/tools   # on Linux
#TOOLSPATH = $(ARDUINOPATH)/hardware/tools/tools/avr/bin   # on Mac or Windows
```

I simplified the example program and saved it as main.c 

```c 
#include "WProgram.h"

int main(void)
{

	pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
	while (1) {
		digitalWriteFast(13, HIGH);
		delay(101);
		digitalWriteFast(13, LOW);
		delay(900);
	}

}

```

### Under Linux

The alterations to the Makefile were exactly the same as under windows.

* [Makefile](linux/Makefile)

In the case of main.cpp I tested it essentially as extracted from the downloaded Teensyduino archive.

* [main.cpp](linux/main.cpp)

#### Item I lost track of

* <http://forum.pjrc.com/threads/24527-Teensy-3-0-Project-Template>

I should have a closser look at this template (setup for Linux)

## MicroPython
 
### Building Micro Python for Teensy 3.1.

Currently the Teensy 3.1 port of Micro Python builds under Linux and not under Windows.

The tool chain required for the build can be found at <https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded>.

Downlaod the current Linux *.tar.bz2 file. Instructions regarding unpacking the file and moving it to the correct location 
as well as adding the extracted folders to the enviroment variable can be found at 
<http://eliaselectronics.com/stm32f4-tutorials/setting-up-the-stm32f4-arm-development-toolchain/>

### Early Setup to Build Micro Python for Teensy 3.1.

MicroPython was compiled following the instructions at (links to Teensy forum)

* <http://forum.pjrc.com/threads/24794-MicroPython-for-Teensy-3-1?p=39515&viewfull=1#post39515>

and

* <http://forum.pjrc.com/threads/24794-MicroPython-for-Teensy-3-1?p=41582&viewfull=1#post41582>

MicroPython was cross compiled on a Linux computer. Once the hex file is created it can be loaded onto the Teensy3.1. 
I accessed Micropython via Minicom on Linux. I also accessed it using PuTTY on a Windows computer. A short interactive session with MicroPython can be seen here:
