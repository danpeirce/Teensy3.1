# Teensy 3.1

Notes Related to Teensy 3.1 ARM MCU Board

* [The Teensy 3.1 web page](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensy31.html)

The Teensy 3.1 board can be used for projects written in C, Arduino and/or MicroPython. I'm intrigued by the 
possibilities in an educational set ting. With that in mind I will acquire one of these boards and explore the possibilities.

## Installation

The pjrc Teensy web page gives a good set of instructions on the installation for the Teensy 3.1. 
The steps include downloading software for Arduino and then downloading and installing Teensyduino. 
Even the Micro Python project assumes this will be done.

I'll need to get a board to try this.
